## Pages

* Landing page (Home) `index.html`
* About page `about.md`
* All projects and blog posts are written under the `_posts` directory

## Theme Set-up

1. Go to the original [Indigo Minimalist Jekyll Template](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo).
2. [Fork](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo/fork) the project.
3. Rename the repo to `your-username.github.io` if you want that to be your site url, otherwise if you keep indigo as the repo name like I did then the site url will automatically be `your-username.github.io/indigo`.
4. Update `_config.yml` with your own personal details.
5. Read Arti's [blog post](http://artiannaswamy.com/build-a-github-blog-part-2) for further customizations.

## My edits

Besides the standard personalization needed to make this website mine, here is a list of additional edits I have made to the theme:

* Customized a minimal header that goes on every page besides the landing page and a draft feature to blog posts - from Arti's [blog](http://artiannaswamy.com/build-a-github-blog-part-2#different-headers). 
* Added google scholar as a social link, but using the same icon as Google - let me know if you can help me add a new icon for the official google scholar icon (it's a lower-case 'g' with a tilted graduation cap).
* (currently working on) adding an automatic system datetime for when the site was last updated into the footer.
