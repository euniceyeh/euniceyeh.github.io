description: "A quick summary post about my final Genomic Data project on Quantitative Microbiome Profiling."
---

As part of the Spring 2018 course in Genomic Data Manipulation (BST 281) taught by [Curtis Huttenhower](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard Chan](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/), we had discussed quantitative analytical issues that arose in the most recent 'omics publications in a style of a journal club. Specifically, my group reviewed and presented to the class a recent [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24460) that proposes Quantitative Microbiome Profiling (QMP) to address the issue of microbial load variability across samples, which has been a major limitation of relative microbiome profiling (RMP), the current most common aproach to measuring microbial composition in the gut. Thus, for our final group project, we applied our own variant of the QMP method on longitudinal fecal samples from a participant with Crohn's Disease (CD) vs. a healthy control from the [NIH Human Microbiome Project (HMP2)](https://www.ibdmdb.org/).

- Our journal club presentation shown above summarizes [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24460).
- The [final project presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wulo-3Q8p5BdtOY5yeQ1isGAyF6d4yr96W1VdsrRF8s/edit?usp=sharing) gives you a quick overview/analysis plan with preliminary results that generated class discussion.
- Our project's [Github repo](https://github.com/euniceyeh/EHR-Project) contains all the data manipulation and analysis programs written in python, R, and mathematica.
- You can read my individual write-up for the project [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euniceyeh/indigo/gh-pages/assets/files/BST281_eunice_yeh_final_project.pdf).
